# Movie Recommendation System
A collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system built using TensorFlow. This project predicts movie ratings for users based on their historical preferences, designed as a prototype for personalized streaming services like Netflix.

## Features
- Implements a collaborative filtering approach using user and movie embeddings.
- Predicts user ratings for unseen movies.
- Trains on the MovieLens dataset, a benchmark for recommendation systems.
- Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Built with Python and TensorFlow, leveraging NumPy and Pandas for data handling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
